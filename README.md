# Performance-comparison
With the recent launch of LLM and its performance, researchers are looking to see how well it will perform on a remote sensing data

The dataset we would be using to make this comparison is the UC_Merced Land Dataset. You can download the dataset <a href="http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html">here</a>
<h3>Dataset Structure</h3>
<p> 21 classes of image data, each comprising 100 pictures.</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
<p> ResNet: This consists of ResNet18, ResNet50 and ResNet101. The model was trained using the different versions </p>
